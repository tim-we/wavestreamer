**wavestreamer** is a lightweight music playback system written in Go, designed to run continuously on a Raspberry Pi.

It is the spiritual successor to [py-radio](https://github.com/tim-we/py-radio/), rewritten from scratch for better performance, maintainability, and flexibility.

A binary for AArch64 architecture (Raspberry Pi) is build by a GitHub Actions workflow.

### Features

- üéµ Plays music from a local library (any format ffmpeg can handle)
- üåê Optional web app to control playback (skip, pause, repeat, schedule)
- üïí Plays hourly news (currently supports *Tagesschau in 100 Sekunden*)
- üß† Simple, reliable, and built for 24/7 use on low-powered devices


## Installation on a Raspberry Pi

We assume the 64bit version of Raspberry Pi OS.
Setting up the service is optional, 
it just automatically starts the program after the Pi boots.

1. For wavestreamer to run on a Raspberry Pi we need to install the following dependencies: 

    ```bash
    sudo apt update
    sudo apt install libportaudio2 ffmpeg screen
    ```

2. Copy files from `pi-files`
    - Copy `start-radio.sh` to the home folder (e.g. `/home/pi`)
    - Copy `radio-service` to `/etc/systemd/system/radio.service` and update the paths inside

3. Setup service:
    - `sudo systemctl daemon-reexec`
    - `sudo systemctl daemon-reload`
    - `sudo systemctl enable radio.service`
    - `sudo systemctl start radio.service`

You can access the running program on the Pi with `screen -R radio`.

## Development

### Initial Setup

To build this program yourself you need go (check the version in `go.mod`) and node.js (check the version in `webapp/package.json#engines.node`).

1. Check out this repo locally.
2. Change into the `webapp` directory (`cd webapp`).
3. Run `npm install` (this has to be done only once)
4. Run `npm run build` (this has to done at least once and for every webapp change).

Now the `webapp/dist` folder should be populated with files.
We are now ready to run the player.

### Running / Building

You can start the program locally with 
```bash
go run wavestreamer.go --help
```
